# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple SwiftUI Game, where you play Tic Tac Toe.

I was able to do this project, thanks to [Sean Allen](http://seanallen.co), who did a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCLiPW2ns2w) for it.
When creating the app, I was a beginner. So, by watching and coding along, I learnt a lot of Swift/-UI related things and can now move on to doing my own projects!
